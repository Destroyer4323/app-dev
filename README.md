**This is my current favorite series in Anime**

1. **Sword Art Online Series**
- A popular Isekai to this day
- The First season of 2nd half is the most questionable decision & scene
- The Second season has another questionable scene except for the Yuki & Excalibur Arc
- SAO Alicization Arc should have been the first season and another questionable in this season (referring to the Student scene...)
  
2. **Hyouka**
- Animation of KyotoAnimation is a perfect fit for the series
- An intriguing story that I've fallen for years
- The main character is lazy but finds ways to maximize time

3. **Great Pretender**
- A great storyline & the ending music is to pay tribute to the legend Freddie Mercury
- Thierry, Laurent is the best Con-Artist MC of the show
- The show itself is a must-watch for each character's adventure, storytelling, and back story.

4. **Angel Beats**
- Maeda, Jun second best work (Clannad #1)
- The main character's back story is very emotional & touching
- The first anime that made me cry
