# This is my current favorite series in Anime

1. **Sword Art Online Series**
 - A popular Isekai to this day
 - The First season of 2nd half is the most questionable decision & scene
 - The Second season has another questionable scene, The Yuki & Excalibur Arc is fine
 - SAO Alicization Arc should have been the first season because of progression & storytelling.
 - SAO Progressive is the retelling of the Franchise the novel itself is very detailed, and the anime adaption has slight adjustments, especially in adding a character to have the Protagonist pursue on play the game.
  
2. **Hyouka**
 - Animation of KyotoAnimation is a perfect fit for the series
 - An intriguing story that I've fallen for years
 - The main character is lazy but finds ways to maximize time

3. **Great Pretender**
 - A great storyline & the ending music is to pay tribute to the legend Freddie Mercury
 - Thierry, Laurent is the best Con-Artist MC of the show
 - The show itself is a must-watch for each character's adventure, storytelling, and back story.

4. **Angel Beats**
 - Maeda, Jun second best work (Clannad #1)
 - The main character's back story is very emotional & touching
 - The first anime that made me cry
